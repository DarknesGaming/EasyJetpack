InfinityJetpacks
===========

Based on the [EasyJetpack](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/easyjetpack/) plugin by j_selby

Fly around with jetpacks, rocket boots, and put a nether star to use with this plugin! Java 8 is required for this plugin to work.

The current version is 1.7 Beta 4. Use it at your own risk, as they may not be "stable."

Release builds can be found in the release page for this project. Thanks to Paul Vogel for making this plugin compatible with Minecraft 1.9.4.

This plugin supports [AntiCheatReloaded](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/AntiCheatReloaded/) and, as of 1.7 Beta 4, [NoCheatPlus](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/NoCheatPlus). I am adding support to more Anti-Cheat plugins very soon.
